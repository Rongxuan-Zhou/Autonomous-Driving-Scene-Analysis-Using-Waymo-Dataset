This flowchart illustrates the complete processing pipeline for the Waymo Open Dataset. Starting from the top, the data first goes through the preparation stage, which branches into three parallel steps: TFRecord Parsing, MCAP Conversion, and Coordinate System Transformation. These processed data streams converge into Multi-sensor Data Processing, which further divides into three branches: LiDAR Point Cloud Processing, Camera Image Processing, and Sensor Fusion. All this information is then used for three perception tasks: 3D Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, and Scene Classification. Finally, the results are presented and analyzed through Quantitative Evaluation and Interactive Visualization. 

Here I would like to introduce MACP, a standardized container format for storing heterogeneous robotics data. With MCAP, we are empowered to focus on more important visualization problems and avoid wasting precious time developing custom file formats.
